# ODE.DC-DC.Converters

In this repository you will find useful codes for direct current to direct current (DC-DC) type power electronics converters. You will notice that there are unnecessary packages such as ControlSystems.jl, LinearAlgebra.jl and LaTeXStrings.jl, I have left them in the header for later control tasks. The parameters and dynamic equations were taken directly from the reference that is in the header of each code, however, I would like to remember that if you want to investigate more on the subject, I highly recommend reading the following reference:



```bash
@article{perez2016electronica,
  title={Electr{\'o}nica de potencia: modelado y control de convertidores cd-cd},
  author={P{\'e}rez Ram{\'\i}rez, J and Beristain Jimenez, JA},
  year={2016}
}
```
You can see the book in here:

You will notice that most of the information is in Spanish, I hope later to make a tutorial in Medium where I develop the models and the use of the algorithms, if it becomes the case, I will add a link to the tutorial in the future.
